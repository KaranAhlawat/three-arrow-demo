# Three Arrow Demo
This repository contains a fully responsive, mobile first landing page modeled after [ueno.](https://ueno.co/) The webpage was created as part of an internship assessment for the Three Arrow company, for the position of a front-end developer.

## Technologies Used
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Assets from [ueno.](https://ueno.co)

## Learnings
This project gave me the opportunity to get comfortable with modern React.js based on functional components and hooks, and build a slightly complex web page with it. Moreover, it gave me the opportunity to explore Tailwind CSS, which has become one of the most used CSS libraries in recent years.
